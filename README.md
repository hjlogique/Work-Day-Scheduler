```
The “Work Day Scheduler” is a simple daily planner application which saves 
users' daily schedules between 7AM and 7Pm for each hour a day. In the 
top banner, the application displays the current date which has a live time
clock. The application has thirteen rows. Each row represents an hour of the 
day and has three horizontal sections. The first section on the left displays 
each hour of the day. The middle section is where users can type in their daily
schedules. The third section on the right contains a button to save the entry.
The application lets users know the past events, the current one and the ones 
ahead by categorizing the events (rows) in different colors. As time goes to 
past or if it is not a working hour, the rows become dark gray. As soon as the 
working hour starts, the rows become dark blue. One orange row always displays
the current hour schedule. After saving their schedules, users can reopen the 
application and their schedules are always available during the working hours.

Note: The first screenshot below displays the scheduler during the working 
hours. The red row is the current scheduled plan and the blue rows are the 
upcoming ones. The second screenshot displays the scheduler after the working
hours before the midnight.

I accomplished the followings:

- Created an application that saves users' daily schedules and plans
  in the local storage, verifies if a schedule is old, current or upcoming,
  and displays them in different colors accordingly.  
- Created different elements (Bootstrap components) through JQuery and 
  JavaScript dynamically.
- Used the MomentsJs functions to access time in different formats and 
  verify Past, Present and Future tenses.
- Saved the time and user's entered information to the local storage and 
  updated the information on the display using the saved data.
- Tested the overall functionality of the app for working hours and
  other hours during a day.
- Uploaded the updated files to my personal GitHub repository, and made the 
  URLs to my deployed application, and my GitHub repository available.
